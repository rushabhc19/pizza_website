README for pizza2 solution

This project is meant to be installed at /cs637/username/proj2/pizza2
relative to the document root, where username is your topcat username.

Under Windows XAMPP, at \xampp\htdocs\cs637\username\proj2\pizza2
Under Mac OSX XAMPP, at /Applications/XAMPP/xampfiles/cs637/username/proj2/pizza2
Under Linux XAMPP, at /opt/lampp/cs637/username/proj2/pizza2

To be ready to run this project on topcat, you need to edit in your
topcat username in one place in these sources, as explained in
comments in these files, in model/database.php

Once this edit is done, the project is set up to be deployed
at c:\xampp\htdocs\cs637\username\proj2\pizza2   for XAMPP on Windows
at /Application/XAMPP/htdocs/cs637/username/proj2/pizza2   for XAMPP on Mac
at /opt/lampp/htdocs/cs637/username/proj2/pizza2   for XAMPP on Linux
at /var/www/html/cs637/username/proj2/pizza2  for apache on topcat
where username is your topcat username.

Note that the error handling has been simplified by combining database_error.php
into error.php, where the database case is discovered by instanceof on the 
error object. The catches are now on Exception, so more kinds can be caught,
including the Guzzle exceptions needed for the web services.

For better security, an .htaccess file has been added to directories
database and model, both of which contain database credentials. The
.htaccess file (with contents "deny from all" ensures that no files in the 
directory may be accessed from the web, assuming an Apache web server.
